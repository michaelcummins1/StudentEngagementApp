# Student Engagement App
Created by: Russell Abraham, Michael Cummins, Devin Franchino, Tyler Houser, Jaheim Oates

## Project Proposal
### Description:
We will create an app to replace the need for organizations on campus to use the Outlook email app to reach the students of Ursinus College. The app will function as a general newsboard for the campus, allowing organizations to send notifications to the Ursinus Community about events or activities. Users will be able to filter their feed from the general campus community to organizations they are interested in or are a part of. This app will allow for better real-time notifications of students for time pressing events, to ensure that the students do not miss any opportunities on campus. The app can be treated as a local, controlled newsboard with customization options for students as well as giving student engagement and other similar organizations the ability to reliably contact every student on campus.

### Compelling Need:
It is a very common complaint of students at Ursinus that their email, being their main form of academic communication with professors and peers, is constantly flooded with emails from student engagement and other campus-located clubs. Creating an app that still allows for these organizations to contact students freely while also separating the academic correspondence from the community and activity correspondence would remove the negative stigma on campus associated with campus wide communication. Furthermore, the application can allow for students to select certain clubs or organizations whose messages are more important to them, and become a pseudo “follower” of that organization, allowing for further student-oriented filtration of the messages they receive.

### Stakeholder Groups:
Our stakeholder groups include the office of student engagement and presidents, organizers, and members of student clubs, societies, and activities as the population of users who would be sending or posting messages on the app. We will rely on their feedback to determine exactly how much freedom they will require in their posts, as well as how much interaction they would like between the senders and receivers. The general student body and Ursinus Community would be the stakeholder group for the population of users who receive the messages and can filter their feed for a personalized experience. We will rely upon their feedback to determine the most appealing UI as well as how to best handle the filtering of clubs and/or notifications for the best use case for the receivers.

### What we plan to learn
- How to create an app that can function on both Android and iOS smartphones.
- Explore web based vs in app interfaces.
- Storing specific user information (clubs they want to follow, etc.) and saving state over multiple opening and closing of the apps.
- Storing and sending messages from senders to users.

### Minimum Viable Project Scope:
A basic newsboard app that can notify students of events on campus, and allows students to filter their feeds to better match their interests. There will be a clear distinction between the senders and receivers of the messages and posts, and we want to give senders freedom in both what they post and what appears in the notification to the receivers. The receivers will have freedom in which clubs they choose to ‘follow’ in order to be able to filter their news feed in a separate tab.

### Aspirant Scope:
Users can directly message other users within the same groups as them (i.e. clubs, classes, organizations) and can comment on posts. This would require filters for obscene language and bullying/hateful remarks. Another potential route for the project would be to have access to students schedules and automatically create groups for each class they are a part of; the students would then have means to contact their professors and other students within their class, adding academic assistance to the app’s functionalities. Professors would then be able to use the app as a way of sending messages directly to the students in a more reliable manner than outlook, functioning similarly to how the CS department at Ursinus uses Discord.
